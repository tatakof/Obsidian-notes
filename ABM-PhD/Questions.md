GEORGE, JMM, JMG: How to represent patches?

In GIS based systems, we have something like this 
![[Pasted image 20230112104601.png]]
and you would think of these patches as big areas, where agents can move. 
But in Agents.jl's GridSpace, we have pixels where agents can move, so we maybe have to do something like a patch equals M x M pixels?
