Data-driven science starts from observations and searches for regularities using generic models. Model-driven science takes more advanced problem-specific models and aims at evaluating and improving their quality on one hand, and explore their consequences on the other hand. In terms of day-to-day research activities, data-driven science collects observations that promise to be interesting and uses statistical methods to interpret them. Model-driven science has theoreticians exploring models and experimentalists asking Nature specific questions arising from this exploration. The oldest and best-known scientific disciplines, i.e. physics and chemistry, are primarily model-driven today, which may contribute to the impression that data-driven science is new. As the epicycle example shows, this is really just a lack of historical perspective.
