The environment commonly has a well-defined task. The goal of this task is defined through
the reward signal. The reward signal can be dense, sparse, or anything in between. When you design environments, reward signals are the way to train your agent the way you want. The more dense, the more supervision the agent will have, and the faster the agent will learn, but the more bias you’ll inject into your agent, and the less likely the agent will come up with unexpected behaviors. The more sparse, the less supervision, and therefore, the higher the chance of new, emerging behaviors, but the longer it’ll take the agent to learn.
