rigid transformations (i guess hes talking about linear algebra transformations) are translations and rotations, not stretching or bending or anything like that. 

sigma-algebra: 
given a set omega (any set), a sigma algebra on omega is a collection denoted A that is a subset of the power set of omega. the sigma algebra is non empty, it's closed under complements (if theres some set E that belongs to the sigma algebra, then the complement of E is also in the sigma algebra) and it's closed under countable unions (if i have a countable collection E1, E2.., are all included in E, then the unions of all E is also in the sigma algebra).
remakars:
-omega is inside the sigma algebra on omega. 
-the empty set is on the sigma algebra
-for any sigma algebra, sigma algebra is closed under countable intersections. 

power set:
the power set of omega is the collection of all possible subsets of omega. Power set of omega is sometimes denoted as $2^{\omega}$ .
