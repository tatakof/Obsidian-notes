When we build models for a given task there are many modeling choices we have to make:
- Network architecture
- Learning rates
- Data augmentation strategies
- Others..


*Hyperparameters* is what we call to all these modeling choices. 
"Hyperparameters are parameters about parameters. That is, they are high-level choices that govern the meaning of the weight parameters"
