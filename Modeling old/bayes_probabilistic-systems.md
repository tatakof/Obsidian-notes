Epistemological variation is particularly common in the study of dynamical systems. Chaos theory, for example, arises when infinitesimal uncertainty in initial conditions is evolved through nonlinear, but deterministic, dynamics. This evolution results in probabilistic behavior of the system despite its fundamental determinism. Likewise thermodynamics is a theory of probabilistic behavior in many-particle systems that emerges from deterministic microscopic dynamics when only certain macroscopic quantities can be observed.
