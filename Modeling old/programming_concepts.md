#### Escaping (\\)
m'When we say that we escape, using the \ operator, we mean that we avoid or escape the normal behaviour of the character that comes next'. E.g., If when writing math equations we use "\" to start a symbol, the normal behavour of \ in that context is not to write the character "\". So if we want to explicitly write that character, we have to avoid or escape the normal behaviour (in that context) by using the escape operator \. (WTF but yes). So if we want to write "\" in markdown math, we have to write "\\"

Not really working the \\ here, maybe look for another example. 




#### Intractable problems
From a computational complexity stance, intractable problems are problems for which there exist no efficient algorithms to solve them. 
Most intractable problems have an algorithm that provides a solution, and that algorithm is brute-force search. The algorithm, however, does not provide an efficient solution and is, therefore, not feasible for computation with anything more than the smallest input. 

"The reason there is no efficient algorithms for these problems is that these problems are all in a category which i like to refer as "slightly less than random". They are so close to random, in fact, that they do not as yet allow for any meaningful algorithm other that that of brute-force." m'I'm not sure this explains all intractable problems'
