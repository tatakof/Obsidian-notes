- Statements at the beggining of a post: 
	- This project was driven by my desire to speak math, just as I speak a language like Spanish or English, or I speak a programming language like R or Python. That is, my desire to be able to understand what math means (or what each math statement means) and to be able to translate between my ideas (with their language) to the mathmatical language). In some sense, this project is a humble attempt at writting a translation manual between two languages: spoken language and math language. 
	- Have in mind that I wasn't trained as a mathematician, but as a biologist. So I this project will surely have some mistakes or misunderstandings. 
	- This is a living piece of writing, which gets updated as I keep on understanding math.  
	- I would love this to be a community project, where other people provide feedback, and say how they understand a given mathematical object or formula.

# In Probability

Dividing by P(B) is equal to filtering by P(B), that is only looking at the cases where B happens. 
If you want to know $P(A, B) / P(B)$, you filter the data set for the cases where B happens, and then check the amount of cases where A also happens. 

In  terms of Venn diagrams, where A and B are two circles that overlap, dividing by P(B) is equivalent to zooming into the B circle (or only taking into account that area) and then checking the area that is overlapped with A. Thus $P(A, B) / P(B)$ is equal to the area of the overlapping of A and B divided by the total area of P(B). In the same line, when we say $P(A | B)$ we are saying "conditional on B happening, what is the prob of A", which is the same as zooming into the B circle (as if our world now is just the B circle) and then checking the area of A. And, since we are only looking at the circle B, and A overlaps with B, checking the area of A implies checking the area where A and B co-occur. We can translate this written statements into probability formulas:)
"where A and B co-occur" = "P(A, B)"
"conditional on B happening" or "zooming into the B circle as if our world now is just the B circle" = "1 / P(B)"

# Algebra
- Dividing X by Y means asking how many times Y fits into X. 

- Dividing as scaling: Every number is always being divided by 1, thus the unit is the scale. If we divide any number by a number X, we are scaling that given number by X. And with scaling we mean: how bigger or smaller is a number relative to X? If X is 1, then for example the number 8 is eight times bigger than X. But if X is 2, then the number 8 is four times bigger than X. How many times a given number is bigger or smaller than X is the result of the division $Number / X$. 
Give example with Z-score.
