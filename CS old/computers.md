- Slots

PCI express slot is for GPU

PCI express slots can be shorter or larger.
Larger ones for sound card, network card, gpu 
Shorter ones can be for soun card, network card but not gpu



M.2 Slot is for M.2 SSDs

SATA slots are for SATA SSDs and Mechanical drives. Connect with sata cable.

M.2 SSD attach to computer through PCIe 3 and occupying up to four lanes, or sata 3 ubs3

M.2 NVMe SSD come with different amount PCIe lanes, the more the faster. 4 lane NVMe come with 1 key, whereas some 2 lane will come with 2 keys, like the M.2 SATA

Form factor equal size?
SSDs come in form factors of 2.5 SSDs and M.2 SSD (the M for MiniSata)

2.5 inch ssd connect to computer by cable
M.2 SSD connect directly into motherboard 
M.2 SSD come in a variety of sizes which are expressed as a code, e.g., a 2280 M.2 device has a size of 22mm x 80mm.

Not all M.2 devices are SSDs.
Many motherboards slots can accomodate many M.2 sizes. 

There are SSDs that connect to a PCIe slot. 
There are also PCI PCIe add-in car adapters that allow one or more M.2 SSDs to be plugged into a standard PCIe slot. 

There's also de older mSATA that came before the M.2
Most common form factors are M.2 and 2.5 inch.

SSDs are available with a variety of different interfaces, most common are. 
- SATA (max transfer speed of 550 MB/s)
- PCIe NVMe (max transfer speed 7000 MB/s). PCIe NVMe interface can be referred as PCIe interface, NVMe interface or PCIe NVMe interface

He says something of the fastest ssds pcie nvme are connected to computers with a pcie 4.0 interface. So there's pcie that are not 4.0?

SSD FORM FACTOR DOES NOT DETERMINE ITS INTERFACE!
So M.2 SSDs can be SATA or NVMe!

IMPORTANT TO CHECK JUST WHICH KIND OF M.2 SSD YOUR SYSTEM SUPPORTS. 

modern motherboards (at 2020) have slots that work with both sata and nvme m.2 drives. 

All m.2 devices have slots or keys that prevent them being fitted into the wrong kind of m.2 slot. 
M.2 ssds can be either B key, M key or B&M key

Al modern NVMe drives are M Keyed (1 hole).

M.2 ssd SATA are B&M keyed (2 holes)

M.2 primary socket vs secondary. 
https://www.thefpsreview.com/2021/09/28/primary-m-2-socket-vs-secondary-m-2-socket-which-is-faster/


Your Primary M.2 socket and your Secondary M.2 socket are not the same.  They may both claim to have PCI-Express 4.0 x4 performance support, but the path to get there, and the lanes they connect to, come from different places.  This potentially creates latency issues and potentially causes performance differences on high-performance SSDs.

RAM

laptop and PCs use different types of rams (due to size, laptops ram are smaller)
Desktops pcs use DIM ram
Laptops use SODIM 
DDR4 is faster than 3, motherboards can only use one type. 


Clock speed determines how fast can ram can process data.
