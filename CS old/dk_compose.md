Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. To learn more about all the features of Compose, see [the list of features](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#features).

Compose works in all environments: production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows. You can learn more about each case in [Common Use Cases](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#common-use-cases).

Using Compose is basically a three-step process:

1.  Define your app’s environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be reproduced anywhere.
    
2.  Define the services that make up your app in `docker-compose.yml` so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
    
3.  Run `docker compose up` and the [Docker compose command](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/) starts and runs your entire app. You can alternatively run `docker-compose up` using the docker-compose binary.
