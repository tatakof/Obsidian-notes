- Do you need to know how to calculate gradients yourself?
Manual calculation of the gradients are not required, as deep learning libraries will automatically calculate the gradients for you. This feature is known as automatic differentiation. In PyTorch, if requires_grad=True, the gradients can be returned by calling the backward method: a.backward()
