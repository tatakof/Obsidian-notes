### Probabilistic Modeling and Statistical Inference

- the latent phenomenon is encompassed within the true data data generating process? what does this mean?. 
"In particular, successful inferences advice decisions about how to interact with the latent phenomenon encompassed within the true data generating process."
- Is a model configuration for e.g. for a gaussian a single value of mu and a a single value of sigma? so if in a bayesian context we have a distribution of posterior mu values, that means that we have a distribution of model configurations? I thought that a model configuration was like a model variant. "Once we limit out consideration to a given observational model, our inferential goal becomes the quantification of those model configurations that are somehow similar to the true data generating process, and hence useful for informing our ultimate decisions. If the observational model contains the true data generating process then basing our inferences on the observational model incurs no loss; an exhaustive search through the observational model will always be able to find the true data generating process. We are not always, however, so fortunate. What happens when the true data generating process lies outside the scope of the observational model?"
- Is a data generating process a model with point values of parameters? and the model configuration space is the same model but with distributions of parameters? If the true data generating process is a model with point parameters, then we are always assuming some sort of determinism of the world we are trying to understand. 

- What is a model configuration? a model with the uncertainty of its parameters? or one parameter value of one model? (seems like the later)

- I dont get the model mapping thing, see definitions. 

- So depending on the probe you use, there's an emerging and distinct observational process. But the observational process doesn't produce constant observations, but rather a variation of possible outcomes within an observation space. I guess this observation space is also defined by the probe you use to inspect the phenomenon and its environment?. And the observation space is the consequence of there being sources of variability that doesn't allow the realized observations to be constant?
  And we model an observational process with a probability distribution over the observation space (i.e., the space of all possible observations that can emerge due to the probe we used, and due to the sources of variability of the system? with the system being the latent phenomenon + the environment). 
- what the difference between the observational space and the data we collected? the data we collected are just realizations of that observational space?  


- Observational process vs Observation space
???????

- Observation space. 
the variation of possible outcomes of an observation process??
with variability sources being epistemological, ontological or others?





- "More specifically, once we allow probability distributions over the model configuration space then the observational model becomes more than just a collection of data generating processes – it becomes a _conditional probability distribution_ over the product of the observational space and model configuration space, Y×S, that we can specify with conditional probability density functions,"
