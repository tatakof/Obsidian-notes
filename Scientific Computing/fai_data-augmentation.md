Data augmentation is a technique that creates random variations of the input data (the independent variable) but that preserves the labels. 
In image recognition, this techniques can be brigthness and contrast changes, rotation, flipping perspective warping and others. 

Fastai has a standard set of augmentations that they found work pretty well, and you can use it with `aug_transforms(mult=)`
