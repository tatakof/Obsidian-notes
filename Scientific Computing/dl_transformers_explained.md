las redes estan adaptadas para los diferentes tipos de datos que usamos

redes convolucionales son para entender datos espaciales como im√°genes
redes recurrentes para entender datos secuenciales como texto

para poder entender que tipo de mejoras nos ofrece un modelo como los transformers, primero tenemos que entender con qu√© herramientasz cont√°bamos antes para procesamiento de lenguaje natural nlp.  

La pregunta es: 
si yo tengo una frase cualquiera, c√≥mo la analizo? 

dada la naturaleza secuencial de una frase, donde cada palabra ocupa una posicion en el tiempo una tras otra, la estrategia que se ha venido utilizando en el campo del deep learning es la siguiente 

Tomamos una red neuronal normal, y le damos como input la primera palabra.

![[Pasted image 20221001193519.png]]
dotcsv



Interamente esta palabra se procesar√° multiplic√°ndose capa tras capa con los par√°metros aprendidos de la red. 

![[Pasted image 20221001193719.png]]
![[Pasted image 20221001193653.png]]

Esto es lo tipico de siempre, la novedad viene ahora y es que la informacion que ha sido procesada por la red ahora sera agregada a la nueva informacion que introduciremos en el siguiente paso de nuestra secuencia a la siguiente palabra. 
![[Pasted image 20221001193905.png]]

![[Pasted image 20221001194954.png]]
Conectar el output anterior con el input del procesamiento actual es lo que le da el nombre a este tipo de redes: las RNN

esto permite procesar palabras teniendo en cuenta el contexto de lo que vino antes 

El problema de las RNN es vanishing gradients y ... 
Es decir, que cuando se hace este proceso de nutrir el input con el output anterior muchas muchas veces, el peso que tienen durante el entrenamiento las primeras palabras respecto a las ultimas que hemos agregado es menor a efectos practicos. Esto es el equivalente a la red olvidando cuales eran las primeras palabras de nuestra frase y en consecuencia perdiendo informacion relevante. 

![[Pasted image 20221001195803.png]]

Este problema se soluciona con los mecanismos de atenci√≥n. 

Recuerden que las palabras vienen representadas como vectores num√©ricos y multidimensionales que capturan gran parte de la informaci√≥n sem√°ntica y sint√°ctica de la palabra que representan y con los que podemos ademas operar matematicamente. 

Vectores cuya direcci√≥n en este espaciomultidimensional sea muy parecida, representan conceptos cuyas palabras tambien sean parecidas y se alejaran de aquellas palabras que poco tengan que ver. 

![[Pasted image 20221001200626.png]]


![[Pasted image 20221001200714.png]]


Matematicamente podriamos calcular este angulo para asi estudiar cual es la similitud entre palabras, frases o documentos. 

![[Pasted image 20221001200747.png]]

Nuestro objetivo es buscar una soluci√≥n a este problema de falta de memoria que esta presente en las RNN, es decir esa falta de conexion que parece que existe entre palabras que estan muy distanciadas, que no nos permiten estudiar cuales son sus relaciones. 

Nuestro objetivo sera que cada una de las palabras de nuestra frase, no importa la distancia que hay entre ellas, pueda estudiar cual es su relacion con cada una de las otras palabras de la frase. 
Estamos buscando cual es la relacion de todas las palabras con todas las palabras. 


que tipo de relaciones esta buscando la red neuronal?
relaciones semanticas, etc... 

la pregunta es como podemos automatizar este proceso de busqueda de relaciones?? la idea es que si esas relaciones existen tendran que ser redes neuronales las que aprendan a encontrarlas. 

Para ello, lo que vamos a hacer sera entrenar a dos redes neuronales diferentes par que con estas palabras dadas como input (mismo input a cada red), aprendan a generar dos vectores distintos. 

![[Pasted image 20221001204635.png]]

Una de las redes generara un vector que servira para identificar las propiedades interesantes que caracterizan a dicha palabra. 
La otra red neuronal generara un vector que servira para describir aquellas propiedades interesantes que esta palabra esta buscando. 

Podemos usar la metafora de una llave y una cerradura. Podriamos decir que con cada palabra de nuestra secuencia, estas dos redes neuronales se van a encargar se van a encargar de aprender a generar una llave y una cerradura, llaves que podran interactuar con el resto de las cerraduras de las otras palabras. 

![[Pasted image 20221001205031.png]]

![[Pasted image 20221001205107.png]]
![[Pasted image 20221001205134.png]]

Tenemos que entender que estas llaves aqui son diferentes a las que solemos utilizar en la vida real, y es que aqui cada llave puede funcionar en distintas cerraduras con mejor o peor resultado. Pero en realidad con las redes neuronales no estamos trabajando ni con llaves ni con cerraduras, sino que con vectores. Tenemos un vector llave y un vector cerradura. 

![[Pasted image 20221001205344.png]]
Y por ser vectores (los llave y los cerradura) podemos opera

## What is NLP?

NLP is a field of linguistics and machine learning focused on understanding everything related to human language. The aim of NLP tasks is not only to understand single words individually, but to be able to understand the context of those words.

The following is a list of common NLP tasks, with some examples of each:

-   **Classifying whole sentences**: Getting the sentiment of a review, detecting if an email is spam, determining if a sentence is grammatically correct or whether two sentences are logically related or not
-   **Classifying each word in a sentence**: Identifying the grammatical components of a sentence (noun, verb, adjective), or the named entities (person, location, organization)
-   **Generating text content**: Completing a prompt with auto-generated text, filling in the blanks in a text with masked words
-   **Extracting an answer from a text**: Given a question and a context, extracting the answer to the question based on the information provided in the context
-   **Generating a new sentence from an input text**: Translating a text into another language, summarizing a text

NLP isn‚Äôt limited to written text though. It also tackles complex challenges in speech recognition and computer vision, such as generating a transcript of an audio sample or a description of an image.


Transformer models are used to solve all kinds of NLP tasks

The [ü§ó Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) provides the functionality to create and use those shared models. The [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) contains thousands of pretrained models that anyone can download and use. You can also upload your own models to the Hub!

The most basic object in the ü§ó Transformers library is the `pipeline()` function. It connects a model with its necessary preprocessing and postprocessing steps, allowing us to directly input any text and get an intelligible answer:

By default, this pipeline selects a particular pretrained model that has been fine-tuned for sentiment analysis in English. The model is downloaded and cached when you create the `classifier` object. If you rerun the command, the cached model will be used instead and there is no need to download the model again.

There are three main steps involved when you pass some text to a pipeline:

1.  The text is preprocessed into a format the model can understand.
2.  The preprocessed inputs are passed to the model.
3.  The predictions of the model are post-processed, so you can make sense of them.

Some of the currently [available pipelines](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/pipelines.html) are:

-   `feature-extraction` (get the vector representation of a text)
-   `fill-mask`
-   `ner` (named entity recognition)
-   `question-answering`
-   `sentiment-analysis`
-   `summarization`
-   `text-generation`
-   `translation`
-   `zero-shot-classification`

Let‚Äôs have a look at a few of these!

...


##### A bit of Transformer history

Here are some reference points in the (short) history of Transformer models:
![[Pasted image 20221007201055.png]]

The [Transformer architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) was introduced in June 2017. The focus of the original research was on translation tasks. This was followed by the introduction of several influential models, including:

-   **June 2018**: [GPT](https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf), the first pretrained Transformer model, used for fine-tuning on various NLP tasks and obtained state-of-the-art results
    
-   **October 2018**: [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), another large pretrained model, this one designed to produce better summaries of sentences (more on this in the next chapter!)
    
-   **February 2019**: [GPT-2](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf), an improved (and bigger) version of GPT that was not immediately publicly released due to ethical concerns
    
-   **October 2019**: [DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108), a distilled version of BERT that is 60% faster, 40% lighter in memory, and still retains 97% of BERT‚Äôs performance
    
-   **October 2019**: [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) and [T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683), two large pretrained models using the same architecture as the original Transformer model (the first to do so)
    
-   **May 2020**, [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165), an even bigger version of GPT-2 that is able to perform well on a variety of tasks without the need for fine-tuning (called _zero-shot learning_)
    

This list is far from comprehensive, and is just meant to highlight a few of the different kinds of Transformer models. Broadly, they can be grouped into three categories:

-   GPT-like (also called _auto-regressive_ Transformer models)
-   BERT-like (also called _auto-encoding_ Transformer models)
-   BART/T5-like (also called _sequence-to-sequence_ Transformer models)

We will dive into these families in more depth later on.


## Transformers are language models

All the Transformer models mentioned above (GPT, BERT, BART, T5, etc.) have been trained as _language models_. This means they have been trained on large amounts of raw text in a self-supervised fashion. Self-supervised learning is a type of training in which the objective is automatically computed from the inputs of the model. That means that humans are not needed to label the data!

This type of model develops a statistical understanding of the language it has been trained on, but it‚Äôs not very useful for specific practical tasks. Because of this, the general pretrained model then goes through a process called _transfer learning_. During this process, the model is fine-tuned in a supervised way ‚Äî that is, using human-annotated labels ‚Äî on a given task.

An example of a task is predicting the next word in a sentence having read the _n_ previous words. This is called _causal language modeling_ because the output depends on the past and present inputs, but not the future ones.


## Transformers are big models

Apart from a few outliers (like DistilBERT), the general strategy to achieve better performance is by increasing the models‚Äô sizes as well as the amount of data they are pretrained on.

![[Pasted image 20221007202227.png]]


Unfortunately, training a model, especially a large one, requires a large amount of data. This becomes very costly in terms of time and compute resources.


## Transfer Learning
_Pretraining_ is the act of training a model from scratch: the weights are randomly initialized, and the training starts without any prior knowledge.
![[Pasted image 20220914191019.png]]

_Fine-tuning_, on the other hand, is the training done **after** a model has been pretrained. To perform fine-tuning, you first acquire a pretrained language model, then perform additional training with a dataset specific to your task. Wait ‚Äî why not simply train directly for the final task? There are a couple of reasons:

-   The pretrained model was already trained on a dataset that has some similarities with the fine-tuning dataset. The fine-tuning process is thus able to take advantage of knowledge acquired by the initial model during pretraining (for instance, with NLP problems, the pretrained model will have some kind of statistical understanding of the language you are using for your task).
-   Since the pretrained model was already trained on lots of data, the fine-tuning requires way less data to get decent results.
-   For the same reason, the amount of time and resources needed to get good results are much lower.

For example, one could leverage a pretrained model trained on the English language and then fine-tune it on an arXiv corpus, resulting in a science/research-based model. The fine-tuning will only require a limited amount of data: the knowledge the pretrained model has acquired is ‚Äútransferred,‚Äù hence the term _transfer learning_.

![[Pasted image 20220914191251.png]]

Fine-tuning a model therefore has lower time, data, financial, and environmental costs. It is also quicker and easier to iterate over different fine-tuning schemes, as the training is less constraining than a full pretraining.

This process will also achieve better results than training from scratch (unless you have lots of data), which is why you should always try to leverage a pretrained model ‚Äî one as close as possible to the task you have at hand ‚Äî and fine-tune it.

## General architecture

### Introduction

The model is primarily composed of two blocks:

-   **Encoder (left)**: The encoder receives an input and builds a representation of it (its features). This means that the model is optimized to acquire understanding from the input.
-   **Decoder (right)**: The decoder uses the encoder‚Äôs representation (features) along with other inputs to generate a target sequence. This means that the model is optimized for generating outputs.

![[Pasted image 20220914191823.png]]

**Each of these parts can be used independently**, depending on the task:

-   **Encoder-only models**: Good for tasks that require understanding of the input, such as sentence classification and named entity recognition.
-   **Decoder-only models**: Good for generative tasks such as text generation.
-   **Encoder-decoder models** or **sequence-to-sequence models**: Good for generative tasks that require an input, such as translation or summarization.

## Attention layers

A key feature of Transformer models is that they are built with special layers called _attention layers_. In fact, the title of the paper introducing the Transformer architecture was [‚ÄúAttention Is All You Need‚Äù](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)! We will explore the details of attention layers later in the course; for now, all you need to know is that this layer will tell the model to pay specific attention to certain words in the sentence you passed it (and more or less ignore the others) when dealing with the representation of each word.

## The original architecture

The Transformer architecture was originally designed for translation. During training, the encoder receives inputs (sentences) in a certain language, while the decoder receives the same sentences in the desired target language. In the encoder, the attention layers can use all the words in a sentence (since, as we just saw, the translation of a given word can be dependent on what is after as well as before it in the sentence). **The decoder, however, works sequentially and can only pay attention to the words in the sentence that it has already translated (so, only the words before the word currently being generated)**. For example, when we have predicted the first three words of the translated target, we give them to the decoder which then uses all the inputs of the encoder to try to predict the fourth word.

To speed things up during training (when the model has access to target sentences), the decoder is fed the whole target, but it is not allowed to use future words (if it had access to the word at position 2 when trying to predict the word at position 2, the problem would not be very hard!). For instance, when trying to predict the fourth word, the attention layer will only have access to the words in positions 1 to 3.

![[Pasted image 20220914192754.png]]

**Note that the first attention layer in a decoder block pays attention to all (past) inputs to the decoder, but the second attention layer uses the output of the encoder. It can thus access the whole input sentence to best predict the current word. This is very useful as different languages can have grammatical rules that put the words in different orders, or some context provided later in the sentence may be helpful to determine the best translation of a given word.**

**The _attention mask_ can also be used in the encoder/decoder to prevent the model from paying attention to some special words ‚Äî for instance, the special padding word used to make all the inputs the same length when batching together sentences.**

## Architectures vs. checkpoints

As we dive into Transformer models in this course, you‚Äôll see mentions of _architectures_ and _checkpoints_ as well as _models_. These terms all have slightly different meanings:

-   **Architecture**: This is the skeleton of the model ‚Äî the definition of each layer and each operation that happens within the model.
-   **Checkpoints**: These are the weights that will be loaded in a given architecture.
-   **Model**: This is an umbrella term that isn‚Äôt as precise as ‚Äúarchitecture‚Äù or ‚Äúcheckpoint‚Äù: it can mean both. This course will specify _architecture_ or _checkpoint_ when it matters to reduce ambiguity.

For example, BERT is an architecture while `bert-base-cased`, a set of weights trained by the Google team for the first release of BERT, is a checkpoint. However, one can say ‚Äúthe BERT model‚Äù and ‚Äúthe `bert-base-cased` model.‚Äù

# Encoder models

Encoder models use only the encoder of a Transformer model. At each stage, the attention layers can access all the words in the initial sentence. These models are often characterized as having ‚Äúbi-directional‚Äù attention, and are often called _auto-encoding models_.

The pretraining of these models usually revolves around somehow corrupting a given sentence (for instance, by masking random words in it) and tasking the model with finding or reconstructing the initial sentence.

Encoder models are best suited for tasks requiring an understanding of the full sentence, such as sentence classification, named entity recognition (and more generally word classification), and extractive question answering.

Representatives of this family of models include:

-   [ALBERT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/albert.html)
-   [BERT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html)
-   [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/distilbert.html)
-   [ELECTRA](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/electra.html)
-   [RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/roberta.html)

# Decoder models
Decoder models use only the decoder of a Transformer model. At each stage, for a given word the attention layers can only access the words positioned before it in the sentence. These models are often called _auto-regressive models_.

The pretraining of decoder models usually revolves around predicting the next word in the sentence.

These models are best suited for tasks involving text generation.

Representatives of this family of models include:

-   [CTRL](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/ctrl.html)
-   [GPT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/gpt.html)
-   [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/gpt2.html)
-   [Transformer XL](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/transfo-xl.html)

# Sequence-to-sequence models

Encoder-decoder models (also called _sequence-to-sequence models_) use both parts of the Transformer architecture. At each stage, the attention layers of the encoder can access all the words in the initial sentence, whereas the attention layers of the decoder can only access the words positioned before a given word in the input.

The pretraining of these models can be done using the objectives of encoder or decoder models, but usually involves something a bit more complex. For instance, [T5](https://huggingface.co/t5-base) is pretrained by replacing random spans of text (that can contain several words) with a single mask special word, and the objective is then to predict the text that this mask word replaces.

Sequence-to-sequence models are best suited for tasks revolving around generating new sentences depending on a given input, such as summarization, translation, or generative question answering.

Representatives of this family of models include:

-   [BART](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bart.html)
-   [mBART](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/mbart.html)
-   [Marian](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/marian.html)
-   [T5](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/t5.html)


# Bias and limitations

If your intent is to use a pretrained model or a fine-tuned version in production, please be aware that, while these models are powerful tools, they come with limitations. The biggest of these is that, to enable pretraining on large amounts of data, researchers often scrape all the content they can find, taking the best as well as the worst of what is available on the internet.
...

When you use these tools, you therefore need to keep in the back of your mind that the original model you are using could very easily generate sexist, racist, or homophobic content. Fine-tuning the model on your data won‚Äôt make this intrinsic bias disappear.


# Behind the pipeline
As we saw in [Chapter 1](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1), this pipeline groups together three steps: preprocessing, passing the inputs through the model, and postprocessing:

![[Pasted image 20220914214900.png]]

## Preprocessing with a tokenizer

Like other neural networks, Transformer models can‚Äôt process raw text directly, so the first step of our pipeline is to convert the text inputs into numbers that the model can make sense of. To do this we use a _tokenizer_, which will be responsible for:

-   Splitting the input into words, subwords, or symbols (like punctuation) that are called _tokens_
-   Mapping each token to an integer
-   Adding additional inputs that may be useful to the model

All this preprocessing needs to be done in exactly the same way as when the model was pretrained, so we first need to download that information from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models). To do this, we use the `AutoTokenizer` class and its `from_pretrained()` method. Using the checkpoint name of our model, it will automatically fetch the data associated with the model‚Äôs tokenizer and cache it (so it‚Äôs only downloaded the first time you run the code below).

Once we have the tokenizer, we can directly pass our sentences to it and we‚Äôll get back a dictionary that‚Äôs ready to feed to our model! The only thing left to do is to convert the list of input IDs to tensors.

You can use ü§ó Transformers without having to worry about which ML framework is used as a backend; it might be PyTorch or TensorFlow, or Flax for some models. However, Transformer models only accept _tensors_ as input. If this is your first time hearing about tensors, you can think of them as NumPy arrays instead. A NumPy array can be a scalar (0D), a vector (1D), a matrix (2D), or have more dimensions. It‚Äôs effectively a tensor; other ML frameworks‚Äô tensors behave similarly, and are usually as simple to instantiate as NumPy arrays.

This architecture contains only the base Transformer module: given some inputs, it outputs what we‚Äôll call _hidden states_, also known as _features_. For each model input, we‚Äôll retrieve a high-dimensional vector representing the **contextual understanding of that input by the Transformer model**.

**While these hidden states can be useful on their own, they‚Äôre usually inputs to another part of the model, known as the _head_. In [Chapter 1](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1), the different tasks could have been performed with the same architecture, but each of these tasks will have a different head associated with it.**
