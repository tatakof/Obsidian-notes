A _prior model_ is defined as a probability distribution over the model configuration space, typically with a probability density function $\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\theta)$. The prior distribution encodes domain expertise about the model configurations in the observational model, and possibly even the context of the observational model relative to the true data generating process and latent observational process.

For example a prior distribution might assign less probability to model configurations that are extreme but not entirely impossible, suppressing their contribution to our resulting inferences. At the same time a prior distribution might suppress model configurations that, while not entirely impossible, we know stress the accuracy of our modeling approximations.

Importantly, prior distributions do not need to encode _all_ of our domain expertise but rather just enough to ensure useful inferences. This can drastically simplify prior specification, for example by allowing priors to be relative ignorant about model configurations on which domain experts disagree. On the other hand, this means that in practice prior specification is best done in the context of the observational model. Consequently best practices for prior specification are most appropriately defined not in general but rather for specific modeling techniques where the complementary behavior of certain components of the observation model can be contrasted to certain component of the prior model.
