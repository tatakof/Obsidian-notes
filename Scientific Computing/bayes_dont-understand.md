"These degrees of covariation can be readily computed from the joint distribution $P(x, y)$" using the $\sigma_{XY}$ equation and the $\rho_{XY}$ equation.'' **DNT**

Both $\sigma_{XY}$ and $\rho_{XY}$ vanish when X and Y are independent. 

Note that nonlinear relationships between Y and X cannot naturally be captured by a simple numerical summary: they require a full specification of the conditional probability $P(Y = y | X = x)$ **DNT**

Why is is so hard to get P(y,x)? because we need all of the data (instead of a sample) to compute it? is regression the method for a sample but if we had infinite data we would never use regression and just compute $E[Y|X = x]$ from $P(y, x)$ ?

Does every variable have a space? that is, space and variable are interchangeable?
