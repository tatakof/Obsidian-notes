### Why use the log

The function we saw in the previous section works quite well as a loss function, but we can make it a bit better. The problem is that we are using probabilities, and probabilities cannot be smaller than 0 or greater than 1. That means that our model will not care whether it predicts 0.99 or 0.999. Indeed, those numbers are so close togetherâ€”but in another sense, 0.999 is 10 times more confident than 0.99. So, we want to transform our numbers between 0 and 1 to instead be between negative infinity and 0. There is a mathematical function that does exactly this: the *logarithm* (available as `torch.log`). It is not defined for numbers less than 0




### Definition
```

y = b**a

a = log(y,b)

```

Perhaps a logarithm is something that you have not thought about for the last 20 years or so. But it's a mathematical idea that is going to be really critical for many things in deep learning, so now would be a great time to refresh your memory. The key thing to know about logarithms is this relationship:

  

log(a*b) = log(a)+log(b)

  

When we see it in that format, it looks a bit boring; but think about what this really means. It means that logarithms increase linearly when the underlying signal increases exponentially or multiplicatively. This is used, for instance, in the Richter scale of earthquake severity, and the dB scale of noise levels. It's also often used on financial charts, where we want to show compound growth rates more clearly. Computer scientists love using logarithms, because it means that multiplication, which can create really really large and really really small numbers, can be replaced by addition, which is much less likely to result in scales that are difficult for our computers to handle.


> s: It's not just computer scientists that love logs! Until computers came along, engineers and scientists used a special ruler called a "slide rule" that did multiplication by adding logarithms. Logarithms are widely used in physics, for multiplying very big or very small numbers, and many other fields.
