#### Functions
A function is a relation that associates elements in one space to elements in another space. If a function, f, maps elements in the space X to elements in the space Y then we write

$$
f : X \rightarrow Y
$$
((So ":" means something like "does the following map of elements" and "$\rightarrow$" means "to" in the sense of X to Y?))

If we want to be particularly explicit and denote how a particular element $x \in X$ maps into elements of Y then we can also write
$$
f: X \rightarrow Y

$$

$$
x \mapsto f(x)

$$

((where $\mapsto$ means "mapsto" and f(x) equals y, that is, the element y of the space Y ))

#### Sub-additivity 
In mathematics, subadditivity is a property of a function that states, roughly, that evaluating the function for the sum of two elements of the domain always returns something less than or equal to the sum of the function's values at each element. 


#### Super-additivity
In mathematics, superadditivity is a property of a function that states, roughly, that evaluating the function for the sum of two elements of the domain always returns something greater or equal to the sum of the function's values at each element. 

#### Permutations
The various ways in which objects from a set may be selected, generally without replacement, to form subsets and the order of the selection matters. 

#### Combinations
The various ways in which objects from a set may be selected, generally without replacement, to form subsets and the order of the selection DOES NOT matter. 

#### Embedding
An embedding is a relatively low-dimensional space into which you can translate high-dimensional vectors. 

#### Identity function
f(x) = x

#### Inclusion map 
If A is a subset of B, then the inclusion map (also inclusion function, insertion, or canonical injection) is the function $\iota$ that sends each element of x of A to x, treated as an element of B: 
$$
\iota : A \rightarrow B
$$
$$
\iota(x) = x
$$

#### Well-posed mathematical problem
A mathematical problem is well-posed, In the sense of Hadamard, if (i) a solution exists, (ii) the solution is unique, and (iii) the solution depends continuously on the input data. 

#### I'll posed mathematical problem 
I guess a problem that is not well-posed in the sense of Hadamard??



#### Equal vs Equivalent
 the difference between equal and equivalent is that the term equal reers to things that are similar in all aspects, whereas the term equivalent refers to things that are similar in a particular aspect. 



#### Closed-Form solution
An equation is said to be a closed-form solution if it solves a given problem in terms of functions and mathematical operations from a given generally-accepted set. For example, an infinite su, would generally not be considered closed-form. However, the choice of what to call a closed-form and what not is rather arbitrary since a new "closed-form" function could simply be defined in terms of the infinite sum. Due to the lack of specifitiy in the above definition, different branches of mathematics often adopt more precise meanings of the term closed-form to apply to concepts therein. 



#### Operation
In mathematics, an operation is a function which takes zero or more input values to a well-defined output value. The number of operands is the arity of the operation

#### Operand
the quantity on which an operation is to be done. 


#### Closure 
In mathematics, a subset of a given set is closed under an operation of the larget set if performing that operation on members of the subset always produces a member of that subset. For example, the positive integers are closed under addition, but not under subtraction: 1 - 2 is not a positive integer even though both 1 and 2 are positive integers.
Similarly, a subset is said to be closer under a collection of operations if it is closed under each of the operations individually. 
The closure of a subset is the result of a closure operator applied to the subset. The closure of a subset under some operations is the smallest subset that is closed under there operations. It is often called span (for example linear span) or the generated set. 

#### Closed
A mathematical object taken together with its boundary is also called closed. For example, while the interior of a sphere is an open ball, the interior tgoether with the sphere itself is a closed ball. 


#### Closure operator
In mathematics, a closure operator on a set S is a function cl : P(S) -> P(S) from the power set of S to itselft that satisfies the following conditions for all sets $X, Y \subseteq S$.
Closure operators are determined by their closed sets, i.e., by the sots of the form cl(X), since the closure cl(X) of a set X is the smallest closed set containing X. 


#### Set
A *set* is a collection of elements, e.g. $A_1 = {2},\ A_2 = {1, 2, 3, 4}$ . All the sets are contained in a given *space* [[math_concepts#Space]]

from https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/probability_theory.html
#### Space
The collection of all the elements under consideration. e.g., the natural numbers is a space $\mathbb{N} = \{0, 1, ... \}$ 

#### Subset
....




#### Closed set
In geometry, topology, and related branches of mathematics, a closed set is a set whose complement is an open set. In a topological space, a closed set can be defined as a set which contains all its limit points. In a complete metric space, a closed set is a set which is closed under the limit operation. This should not be confused with a closed manifold. 

#### Open set
open sets are a generalization of open intervals in the real line. In a metric space - that is, when a distance function is defined- open sets are the sets that, with every point P, contain all points that are sufficiently near to P (that is, all points whose distance to P is less than some value depending on P).
More generally, one defines open sets as the members of a given collection of subsets of a given set, a collection that has the property of containing every union of its members, every finite intersection of its members, the empty set, and the whole set itself. A set in which such a collection is given is called a topological space, and the collection is acalled a topology. 
In practice, however, open sets are usually chosen to provide a notion of nearness that is similar to that of metric spaces, without having a notion of distance defined. In particular, a topology allows defining properties such as continuity, connectedness, and compactness, which were originally defined by means of a distance. The most common case of a topology without any distance is given by manifolds, which are topological spaces that, near each point, resemble an open set of a eclidean space, but on which no distance is defined in general. 

#### Open interval
an open interval does not include its endopoints, and is indicated with parentheses. 


#### Utility 
A quantification of the overall benefit of an action minus any costs. 
$$
\begin{aligned}
U : A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+ \\ 
a \mapsto U(x)

\end{aligned}
$$


### Reciprocal
to get the reciprocal of X, just do $1/X$. Simple AF. 


### Function composition. 
Take the result of one function and pass it to the next, take again the result of this and pass it to a new function. Iterate.
