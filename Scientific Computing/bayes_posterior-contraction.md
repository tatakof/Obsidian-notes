Likewise the _posterior contraction_ of a given parameter,

$$
c[f \mid \tilde{y}] = 1 -
\frac{ \mathbb{V}_{\mathrm{post}}[f \mid \tilde{y} ] }
{ \mathbb{V}_{\mathrm{prior}}[f \mid \tilde{y} ] },
$$

where V denotes the variance, **quantifies how much the likelihood function from a given observation informs the given function. Posterior contraction near zero indicates that the data provide little information beyond the domain expertise encoded in the prior model, while posterior contraction near one indicates observations that are much more informative relative to the prior model.**
