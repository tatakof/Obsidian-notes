### On statistical modeling

In consequence, the observational process are bespoke to both the given phenomenon and the specific details of the probe used to investigate it, especially the environment with which the probe intersects. A critical aspect of statistical modeling is capturing enough of these details to isolate inferences about the latent phenomenon that can then be fairly compared across different experiments. **this is especially true when the specific behavior of the environment or the probe is transient or otherwise not exactly repeatable**. Without a rich understanding of the observational process, phenomenological inferences can poorly generalize outside the of the exact context of the given experiment, promoting more confusion than comprehension.
