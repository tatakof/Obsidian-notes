Once an observational model has been established, and its limitations acknowledged, we can consider _model-based inferences_ that identify which model configurations are most consistent with the true data generating process. Unfortunately without knowing the true data generating process these inferences can be informed only by the information inherent in observed data and our own domain expertise. **Within the context of an observational model, inference becomes the identification of how _consistent_ model configurations are with the observed data and any domain expertise we introduce.**

Consequently the observational model both plays two critical roles. Firstly it defines a context for constructing inferences from observations.

In particular, model-based inferences take the form of a quantification of which model configurations are consistent with the observed data.

Secondly those model-based inferences then inform decisions about how to interact with the latent phenomenon, bridging the gap between the observed data and the latent system.

In order to formally define inference we to define how consistency is mathematically encoded, and then how to calculate consistency assignments in light of a given observation. Unfortunately there is no unique way to encode consistency, and hence no unique way of constructing inferences.
