Principled model development strives for an observational process that captures the relevant structure of the phenomenon, environment, and probe that give rise to the true data generating process. We always have to be careful, to recognize the limitations of the even the most carefully designed observational model in any given analysis.


# Towards A Principled Bayesian Workflow

#### Michael Betancourt

Given a probabilistic model and a realized observation, Bayesian inference is straightforward to implement. At least _conceptually_. **Inferences, and any decisions based upon them, follow immediately in the form of expectations with respect to the induced posterior distribution**. _Building_ a probabilistic model that is useful in a given application, however, is a far more open-ended challenge. Unfortunately the process of model building is often ignored in introductory texts, leaving practitioners to piece together their own model building workflows from potentially incomplete or even inconsistent heuristics.

A principled workflow considers whether or not modeling assumptions are appropriate and sufficient for answering relevant questions in _your_ particular applied context. Because everyone asks different questions in different contexts, such a workflow cannot be reduced to a deterministic algorithm. All we can do is assemble a coherent set of techniques to help us evaluate our own assumptions and guide our unique path through model space.

We will begin with a discussion of what behaviors we want in a probabilistic model, and how we can condense information to guide our evaluation of those behaviors...


Together an observational model, πS(y∣θ), and a prior model, πS(θ), define the complete Bayesian model specified through the joint probability density function

$$
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(y, \theta) =
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(y \mid \theta) \, \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\theta).
$$


**Theoretically we implement Bayesian inference by conditioning the complete Bayesian model on an observation y~ and computing expectation values with respect to the induced posterior distribution.** The utility of these inferences, however, is completely dependent on the assumed Bayesian model. A model inconsistent with the actual data generating process will be of little use in practice, and may even be dangerous in critical applications.


What, however, exactly characterizes a probabilistic model that is consistent enough with a given application? Ideally the model would be compatible with our domain expertise, capturing our knowledge of the experimental design and latent phenomena, or at least enough to domain expertise to enable answers to the inferential questions of interest. It would also help if the model didn't choke our available computational tools so that we could accurately estimate posterior expectation values and faithfully implement the desired inferences in practice. Finally it would be great if our model were rich enough to capture the structure of the true data generating process relevant to our inferential questions.

In other words we can evaluate a model by answering four questions.

#### Question One: Domain Expertise Consistency

_Is our model consistent with our domain expertise?_

#### Question Two: Computational Faithfulness

_Will our computational tools be sufficient to accurately fit our posteriors?_

#### Question Three: Inferential Adequacy

_Will our inferences provide enough information to answer our questions?_

#### Question Four: Model Adequacy

_Is our model rich enough to capture the relevant structure of the true data generating process?_


Even in simple applications, however, these questions can be challenging to answer. We need to carefully examine a candidate model in the context of these four questions and concentrate enough pertinent information to identify any limitations of the model and suggest specific improvements.

## 1.1 Domain Expertise Consistency


**Models built upon assumptions that conflict with our domain expertise will give rise to inferences and predictions that also conflict with our domain expertise. While we don't need our model to capture _every_ last detail of our knowledge, at the very least our models should not be in outright conflict with that knowledge. In order to judge the compatibility of our modeling assumptions and our domain expertise, however, we need to actually acknowledge our implicit domain expertise about the latent phenomena, encapsulating environments, and experimental probes in a given application.**

Unfortunately _eliciting_ our domain expertise, translating our implicit knowledge into something more explicit, is far from straightforward. For example our implicit knowledge often takes the form not of absolute statements but rather relative comparisons that are harder to quantify. Moreover this elicitation takes time and effort which means that our quantifications will _evolve_ with the work we put into the process. The process is even more expensive when domain expertise is spread across a group of individuals.

Ultimately we will never be able to precisely and completely elicit our collective domain expertise in practice. What we can do, however, is elicit a _self-consistent approximation_ to that domain expertise that is sufficient for a given analysis.

From this perspective eliciting domain expertise, and contrasting our model assumptions with that knowledge, is an _iterative_ process. We begin with an initial model and investigate the _consequences_ of that model within relevant contexts. In each context we elicit domain expertise that we have not yet considered and check whether our model consequences are consistent with that knowledge or instead _surprise_ us and suggest improvements towards a more self-consistent model. By focusing on the consequences relevant to a given application we can then refine our complete Bayesian model until we have achieved sufficient consistency.


**Formalizing this process we arrive at visual _prior pushforward checks_ and _prior predictive checks_ which are readily implemented with modern sampling methods, providing powerful instruments for our model building workflow.**

### 1.1.1 Quantifying Consequences

In order to formalize the process for evaluating the consistency between our modeling assumptions and our domain expertise we need to define exactly how we isolate particular consequences of those assumptions, elicit domain expertise in that context, and then compare the elicitation to the consequences.


#### 1.1.1.1 Abridge Too Far

**In any nontrivial analysis where the model configuration space and observational space are relatively high dimensional, the complete Bayesian model and its consequences will be far too big to reason about as a whole. Instead we need to isolate lower-dimensional subspaces that isolate particular consequences and facilitate the consistency analysis.**

**Mathematically this means defining a _summary function_ that projects the entire product space into some interpretable, lower-dimensional space, U, that is relevant to the analysis,**

$$
\begin{alignat*}{6}
t :\; &Y \times \Theta& &\rightarrow& \; &U \subset Y \times \Theta&
\\
&(y, \theta)& &\mapsto& &t(y, \theta)&,
\end{alignat*}
$$

**and then analyzing the corresponding pushforward distribution, πt(Y×Θ)(t). For example when the parameterization of Y×Θ is interpretable the coordinate functions are often useful summary functions.**

When the summary space is the one-dimensional real line, U=R, we can visualize the pushforward distribution with the pushforward probability density function.

Often it's useful to consider a collection of one-dimensional summary functions that might, for example, capture the consequence of our modeling assumptions within ordered categories.

When these discrete categories are approximating a continuous set of summary functions the visualization often benefits from interpolating between neighboring pushforward distributions to fill in the gaps.
