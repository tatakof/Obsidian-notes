For example, the observational model might approximate the true data generating process only within a certain regime of behaviors. At the same time the approximations might accurately capture only some behaviors but not others
A given observational model can express the large scale structure of the latent system but make no attempt to incorporate the structure at smaller scales. It might capture statistical relationships between phenomenological parameters but fail to accurately convey the physical dynamics or explicit causal structure of the phenomenon and its interaction with the environment.




m' can sufficiently complex statistical relationships capture in an IMPLICIT WAY the causal structure of a phenomenon?' is this the battle between yan lecun and judea pearl?
