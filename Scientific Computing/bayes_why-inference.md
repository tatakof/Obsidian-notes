### What is Inference

"a conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning."

"Inference is using observation and background to reach a logical conclusion"

"Human inference (i.e. how humans draw conclusions)..."

"Inferences are steps in reasoning, moving from premises to logical consequences; etymologically, the word infer means to "carry forward". Inference is theoretically traditionally divided into deduction and induction ...

Deduction is inference [deriving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_proof "Formal proof") [logical conclusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence "Logical consequence") from premises known or assumed to be [true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth "Truth"), with the [laws of valid inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_inference "Rule of inference") being studied in [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"). 

Induction is inference from [particular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particular "Particular") evidence to a [universal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_(metaphysics) "Universal (metaphysics)") conclusion.

A third type of inference is sometimes distinguished, notably by [Charles Sanders Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce "Charles Sanders Peirce"), contradistinguishing [abduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning "Abductive reasoning") from induction.

Abductive reasoning is a form of logical inference. It starts with an observation or set of observations and then seeks the simplest and most likely conclusion from the observations. This process, unlike deductive reasoning, yields a plausible conclusion but does not positively verify it. Abductive conclusions are thus qualifies as having a remnant of uncertainty or doubt, which is expressed in retreat terms such as "best available" or "most likely". One can understand abductive reasoning as **inference to the best explanation**, . although not all usages of the terms *abduction* and *inference to the best explanation are exactly equivalent*.

Inference is tasked with quantifying information about the true data generating process using observed data as its only expression. In particular, successful inferences advice decisions about how to interact with the latent phenomenon encompassed within the true data generating process.

"Once we limit our consideration to a given observational model, our inferential goal becomes the quantification of those model configurations (m'that is, the distribution of parameters of a model??') that are somehow similar to the true data generating process, and hence useful for informing our ultimate decisions."
