### Convergence

By definition, a Markov chain generates samples from the target distribution only after it has converged to equilibrium (i.e., equilibrium is defined as being achieved when p(Î¸(n))

is the target density). The following point cannot be expressed strongly enough:

-   In theory, _convergence is only guaranteed asymptotically_ as the number of draws grows without bound.
    
-   In practice, _diagnostics must be applied to monitor convergence_ for the finite number of draws actually available.
