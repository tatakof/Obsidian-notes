## The global burden of pathogens and pests on major food crops, savary et al 2019'

DEBERIA ENCONTRAR ALGO DEL IMPACTO DE CHINCHES WORLDWIDE EN VEZ DE EL IMPACTOS DE PESTES EN GENERAL EN LOS CROPS WORLDWIDE?


Crop pathogens and pests reduce the yield and quality of agricultural production. They cause substantial economic losses and
reduce food security at household, national and global levels. Quantitative, standardized information on crop losses is difficult
to compile and compare across crops, agroecosystems and regions. Here, we report on an expert-based assessment of crop
health, and provide numerical estimates of yield losses on an individual pathogen and pest basis for five major crops globally
and in food security hotspots. Our results document losses associated with 137 pathogens and pests associated with wheat,
rice, maize, potato and soybean worldwide. Our yield loss (range) estimates at a global level and per hotspot for wheat (21.5%
(10.1–28.1%)), rice (30.0% (24.6–40.9%)), maize (22.5% (19.5–41.1%)), potato (17.2% (8.1–21.0%)) and soybean (21.4%
(11.0–32.4%)) suggest that the highest losses are associated with food-deficit regions with fast-growing populations, and
frequently with emerging or re-emerging pests and diseases. Our assessment highlights differences in impacts among crop
pathogens and pests and among food security hotspots. This analysis contributes critical information to prioritize crop health
management to improve the sustainability of agroecosystems in delivering services to societies.



The improvement in the performances of global agricultural
and associated food systems includes the consideration of
crop pests and pathogens (P&Ps)1–4. This is because P&Ps
are widely recognized as significant obstacles to regular and reli-
able food systems5. A recent assessment5 documents how crop P&Ps
can collectively affect all of the components of food security6, from
overall production to physical availability, distribution, economic
access, stability of production, quality and nutritive value.

Furthermore, the shift from small-
scale, diverse, single-cycle agriculture (generally associated with
traditional farming) to large-scale, genetically uniform, intensive
monoculture production (associated with some current farming
systems) has been considered as a disruption of co-evolutionary
processes, which favours strong, large-scale outbreaks and epidem-
ics9 in agroecosystems that have been rendered more vulnerable10,11 to P&Ps

The present work concerns five major crops worldwide—wheat,
rice, maize, potato and soybean—which contribute 18.3, 18.9, 5.4,
2.2 and 3.3% of the global human calorie intake (2013 estimates),
respectively35. Our approach to assessing the global burden of
P&Ps on these major food crops is based on a short-duration
(three-month) survey36 targeted to a large, yet clearly identified,
global community of crop health experts mostly belonging to the
International Society for Plant Pathology (ISPP; see Methods)

Here, we report the results from an online survey conducted
to obtain expert assessments of crop losses for wheat, rice, maize,
potato and soybean as five major crops across the world. The survey
protocol documented a series of variables (Table 1): crop; P&P name
(disease or pest name); reported loss magnitude and frequency;
climate; food security hotspot; emergence status; and national
average (2010–2014) crop yields and associated quartiles.

**This study provides numerical estimates for the yield losses caused
by 137 individual P&Ps on 5 major crops worldwide. It also indi-
cates that global crop losses caused by P&Ps range between 17 and
23% for all five crops, except rice, for which the estimate is 30%.
These estimates are within the same range as the global estimates
for losses to P&Ps reported by Oerke32, using a completely differ-
ent approach for the 2001–2003 period: 21% in wheat, 27% in rice,
21% in maize, 32% in potato and 19% in soybean. This suggests
that the range 20–30% is fairly robust in representing losses to P&Ps
globally, and also that no major changes in crop health occurred
between 2001–2003 and 2017, when this global survey on crop
losses was conducted.**  MAIN STUFF

These consistent associations suggest a linkage between: crop losses
and production situations42 (that is, the biophysical and socioeco-
nomic context where a crop is grown25); reduced crop losses and favourable production situations (where crop health management is
perhaps more efficient); and increased crop losses and less favour-
able production situations (where crop health management is less
effective).
