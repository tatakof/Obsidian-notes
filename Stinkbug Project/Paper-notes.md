### Main differences with our model

Probabilistic? not so much because there are other probabilistic models. 
I guess mainly the purely empiric population dynamics model, that doesn't require information about developmental rates and others (like that K constant etc), the fact that is hierarchical, which allows to expand the model to many different geographical locations taking into account their variability, and the main one, the fact that the observation error is explicitly taken into account. 





### Spatial stuff

Stinkbugs have two maked types?? of spatial distributions: an aggregated one up to flowering of soy and a more uniform one from R5.5 until crop maturation (Kuss et al., 2007a). It is believed that since? nimphs reach 4th stage they can move aproximattely 7-10 meters from oviposition site, and that this is the reason of the two marked spatial distributions (Panizzi et al., 1980). 




### Immigration and overwintering stuff. 

[https://bugguide.net/node/view/182](https://bugguide.net/node/view/182) NEED A PROPER CITATION

Stink bugs overwinter. In early spring, overweintered adult females deposit their eggs on wild host plants tipically found along the field borders. These stink bugs immigrate towards the crop as these plants become more attractive and the initial wild hosts dry down. 


Emerging nymphs are gregarious and remain on/near the egg mass and then disperse as they grow.

### Typical pest control
the vast majority of farmers is using empirical derived pest control options.  (petros damos review 2015)


### Decision tools and models
FROM DAMOS 2015


"Pest models serve as basis of decision making because they offer means to predict the exact time of pest phenological development and initiate management actions" (damos review, from modular structure...). MAYBE WE SHOULD SAY THIS BUT REPLACE THE PEST PHENOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT FOR POPULATION DENSITY AND DYNAMICS. 

The development of reliable decision tools can be used to define an accurate time for the application of control strategies (damos and savopoulousoultani 2012)

most models are climate-driven 


"Data exploitable in integrated crop production (ICP) and IPM, which are often referred as sustainable crop production and pest management, respectively, may contain different 
types of agrodata. Particularly, they can include (1) weather records such as temperature, relative humidity, and weather output; (2) biological data, pest population data and disease symptoms; (3) biophysical data such as plant-growing phenological stages; (4) geophysical data like season climate, soils, terrain, and other characteristics; and (5) socioeconomic information which often include farmer survey results and census information, chemical registrations, residual levels of pesticides, commodity prices, and so on (Waheed et al. 2003; Abdullah and Hussain 2006)."

Agrodata usually includes weather records such as temperature, relative humidity and weather ouput; biological data such as pest population, and crop phenology (CITE Waheed et al. 2003; Abdullah and Hussain 2006?? should check papers)

insects of economic significance are one of the most important threats for crop production. 

"insects are poikilothermic and heterothermic organisms whose development and growth varies considerably in relation to ambient environmental temperature" e.g., insect growth is related to environmental temperature. 


"Models have been also established for the description
of several pest population processes, including population
growth, pest immigration and range expansion, pest emergence and seasonality as well as pest population per se (Cheke and Tratalos 2007). However, only few of these model approaches have been transmuted into practical forecasting tools and related decision support systems."


"Moreover, because ambient temperature regulates direct development, growth, and reproduction, pest phenology forecasting is established by simplified weather-driven models."

there are other factors that may affect insect population dynamics such as photoperiod, and others that are hard to measure such as nutrition, crowding, density and competition (Brown 1984; Rousse et al. 2009)

Most forecasting insect models are mechanistic models based on the effect of temperature (both linear and non-linear) on developmental time and on developmental rate? (not the same thing?). These models take into account the values of the lower, optimum and higher temperature thresholds. (de donde salen estos thresholds ni idea). One consequence of this is that the most-time consuming step in the development of these types of model is the aggregation of biological knowledge of the species of interest, making a model poorly generalizable to other insect species in comparison with empiric modeling approaches. 

"Nietschke et al. (2009) who created an insect development database, which includes developmental requirements for over 500 species to assist scientists and field practitioners in the deployment of phenology models."


"The next step requires the application of population models 
and species temperature thresholds to simulate actual pest 
population dynamics under field conditions. There are various methods and models (i.e., see Sharpe et al. 1977; Pruess 1983; Wagner et al. 1984a; Kontodimas et al. 2004; Van der Have 2008; Damos and Savopoulou-Soultani 2012), but for the reason of brevity, we will mention only the two most common approaches applied in entomology: the physiological time concept and empirical regressions between accumulated degree-days and cumulative population emergence."


Tipically, developmental rate models, the development (1/days) of insects of a given population is modeled as a linear or nonlinear function of temperature (Pajunen 1983) or accumulated degree-days. These tend to be frequentist models   . These models forecast for example the time of adult emergence and of population peak, and are validated using a variety of laboratory and field experiments (damos 2015)

Most of these models are temperature driven, since tempertarue exerts the biggest influence on insect phenology.

These models tend to predict insect phenology, whereas most of the empiric pest control strategies are based on population density at a given time // where action thresholds are based on population density at any given time. 


##justification of climate variables
weather variables that affect population phenology are temperature, relative humidity and rainfall (damos 2015)

Some models took into account the variation between individual insects in their rate of maturation, by trating count rates as random variables instead of as a deterministic quantity (Phelps et al. 1993) VER PAPER. 


##### Why some models fail
temperature-driven models often don't produce reliable forecasts due to missing some factors of the ecological process, such as short-range dispersal, overwintering behavior, colonization patterns, and age-specific mortality including inter and intraspecific competition. 
OUT MODEL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT IMMIGRATION. 




FROM DAMOS AND SAVOPOULOU-SOULTANI 2012. 

"as temperature exerts great influence among the climate variables, by directly affecting insect phenology and distribution" SO TEMPERATURE AFFECTS INSECT DISTRIBUTION AS WELL?

insects are adapted to particular temperature ranges. 

temperature has an inverse parabola effect?? "In general, within optimum ranges of development and as environmental temperature decreases, their rates of development slow and cease at the lowest (base) temperature, while as temperature rises, developmental rates increase up to an optimum temperature, above which they again decrease and eventually cease at their temperature maximum [4, 5, 15, 23, 24]."


Insect development is commonly modeled with the reciprocal of the duration of development as a function of temperature. 

"This simple transformation is used to reveal the relationship type, as it will be shown later
close to linear, between temperature and rate of development and permits the determination of two vital parameters of development namely, the thermal constant (K) and the base or lower temperature of development (Tmin). The thermal constant is expressed as the number of degree-days (in ◦C) and provides an alternative measure of the physiological time required for the completion of a process or a particular developmental event [4, 5, 21, 27]."

From an agronomical standpoint, empirical models are often used to predict specific population events and provide means for precisely applied control methods, reducing costs as well as insecticide use [39, 40] VER PAPERS. 

" Since temperature is considered as the most critical factor affecting insect development, numerous efforts have been made by researchers to propose models to describe such relations either in laboratory or field [6, 16, 22, 28, 29, 39, 40, 43–45]. Moreover, several of these models have been constructed in the view to be applicable for pest management [1, 21, 23, 27, 39, 42, 43, 46–48].





Most of these approaches are based on the empirical detection of relationships and the construction of relative models that in brief capture all information about the response variable in relation to temperature. It should be noted that the presented temperature relationships can be judged as deterministic or empirical, by the sense that they consist of descriptions in which processes are not known, but where relations are established. However, all regression procedures that are followed, for parameter estimation, are
purely probabilistic.
SO THERE ARE PROBABILISTIC MODELS. 


"In applied entomology, empirical approaches are often
used in the construction of developmental models. In
general, the procedures include the delimitation of all the
factors that affect development to the most limiting one,
which is further chosen (i.e., temperature), in order to reveal
empirical dependence of the developmental variable upon
the limiting factor. A function which describes the data with
higher accuracy is plugged to this relation, and its prediction
power is further evaluated by using new datasets."

SO OFTEN MODELS BUILT ARE UNIVARIATE, THEREFORE MISSING IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE POPULATION DYNAMICS. 


"All poikilothermic organisms are related to a speciesspecific thermal constant that corresponds to time units that must be accumulated to complete a particular developmental event. 
The above principle forms the basis for all modeling approaches that have been developed since the first introduction of the heat units concept by Reaumut on 1730 and the following initiation of the temperature summation rule [20, 49]. This rule, which was first proposed by Candolle [6] and characterized the development of all poikilothermic
species, is referred to as the law of total effective temperatures
and consists of the first effort in modeling temperature dependent developmental rates instead of developmental times [7, 31, 50]..........
According to the law of total effective temperatures,
it is possible to estimate the emergence and number of
generations for a given duration, of the organism of interest,
according to the following fundamental equation:
K = D(T - T0), (1) where K is the species (or stage-specific) thermal constant of the poikilothermic organism, T temperature, and T0
developmental zero temperature. This thermal constant
provides a measure of the physiological time required for the
completion of a developmental process and is measured in
degree-days (DD)."

THEY MODEL THE EMERGENCE AND NUMBER OF GENERATIONS FOR A GIVEN DURATION AND OF THE ORGANISM OF INTEREST BASED ON THE SPECIES SPECIFIC THERMAL CONSTANT OF THE POIKILOTHERMIC ORGANISM, THE TEMPERATURE, AND THE DEVELOPMENTAL ZERO TEMPERATURE. 
THE THERMAL CONSTANT (MEASURED IN DEGREE DAYS) OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL TIME REQUIRED FOR THE COMPLETION OF A DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS
