Knowledge of the temporal
constraints that influence sampling is required because arthropod abundance estimates are likely to vary over a growing season and within a day.

Few studies have adequately quantified this effect using
the beat sheet, a potentially important sampling method. We compared the commonly used methods of suction and visual sampling to the beat sheet, with reference to an absolute cage clamp method for
determining the abundance of various arthropod taxa over 5 weeks. There were significantly more entomophagous arthropods recorded using the beat sheet and cage clamp methods than by using suction or visual sampling, and these differences were more pronounced as the plants grew. In a second trial, relative estimates of entomophagous and phytophagous arthropod abundance were made using beat sheet samples collected over a day. Beat sheet estimates of the abundance of only eight of the 43 taxa examined were found to vary significantly over a day. Beat sheet sampling is recommended in further studies of arthropod abundance in cotton, but researchers and pest management advisors should bear in mind the time of season and time of day effects.

These
arthropods were mostly represented by the orders Araneae,
Hemiptera, Neuroptera, and all orders combined, and
generally more arthropods were recorded using beat sheet
and cage clamp than visual or suction sampling methods
(Tables 2 and 3, Figure 1).

Arthropod
abundance generally increased over time as the plants
grew; the estimated abundance of 18 taxa varied
significantly over the sampling period. ESTO PUEDE SER POR LA DINAMICA POBLACIONAL Y NO POR EL SAMPLING METHOD. 

Trial 2: time of day effects
The estimated time to complete each beat sheet sample was
4.4 ± 0.1 min (mean ± SE)

Based on factors such as estimates of
abundance, precision, and cost, the beat sheet was found to
be the most suitable method for sampling the majority of
predators and pests in agricultural crops such as cotton,
snap bean, sorghum, and soybean in nine of the 18, or 50%
of articles reviewed (Shepard et al., 1974a; Young &
Tugwell, 1975; Bechinski & Pedigo, 1982; Adams et al.,
1984; Studebaker et al., 1991; Michels & Behle, 1992;
Snodgrass, 1993; Smith & Stewart, 1999; Kharboutli &
Allen, 2000), while the remainder found it less suitable
(Rudd & Jenson, 1977; Nuessly & Sterling, 1984; Deighan
et al., 1985; Fleischer et al., 1985; Sparks & Boethel, 1987;
Kharboutli & Mack, 1993; Knutson & Wilson, 1999;
McLeod, 2000; Ludy & Lang, 2004)


Several papers have
concluded that no single technique provided the ‘best’
estimate for all lifestages of every species (Shepard et al.,
1974a; Garcia et al., 1982; Kharboutli & Mack, 1993). For
example, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) nymphs
were found to be most effectively sampled using berlese
funnels and adults using visual sampling (Garcia et al.,
1982). Therefore, it is perhaps unrealistic of pest
management advisors and growers to seek a single ‘best’
sampling method for all occasions and of researchers to try
to meet this expectation.

**The influences of the time of growing season and time of
day are two temporal constraints that may account for a
large component of the observed variation between studies
of otherwise similar design. **


**In any case, changes in the proportion of
arthropods collected using various methods are likely to be
affected by the absolute number of arthropods present at
a given moment. It has been suggested that sampling
effectiveness would drop at higher densities because more
arthropods escape before being counted (Deighan et al.,
1985).**

**An inconsistency in the effectiveness of sampling meth-
ods as abundance changes seasonally (i.e., an interaction
between sampling method and date) has important impli-
cations for using arthropod counts in pest management
decision-making (e.g., when using the predator-to-pest
ratio, Mensah, 2002); visual and suction assessments will
likely grossly underestimate the numbers occurring on
plants when arthropod abundance is high, which may
coincide with late in the growing season, but should be
suitable when abundance is low. This means a more com-
plicated correction factor will need to be applied to data
collected because the relationship between the absolute
and relative sampling methods is not constant over the
growing season (e.g., Fleischer et al., 1985; Snodgrass,
1993).**

**However, if the estimates from relative sampling
methods happened to be consistently proportional to
absolute sampling, then it would be possible to rely on
them season long, but this was only the case for beat sheet
sampling. Artificial infestation techniques may help
untangle the effects of variation between sampling meth-
ods, plant height, or volume and time of season (Young &
Tugwell, 1975; Snodgrass, 1993).**



**The influence of time of day is a second temporal con-
straint that may account for a large component of the
observed variation between studies of sampling method
effectiveness. A recommendation exists in sampling proto-
cols to suspend sampling after 10:00 or 11:00 hours when
air temperature exceeds 25–30 °C in an attempt to mini-
mize the escape of insects that readily take flight or drop to
the ground when disturbed (González et al., 1977; Garcia
et al., 1982).** Restrictions placed on sampling when con-
densation (dew) is present have been advised (i.e., between
approximately 18:00–08:00 hours) (Sevacherian & Stern,
1972; González et al., 1977; Garcia et al., 1982). However,
these recommendations appear to be based on anecdotal
evidence.


Thus practitioners should indeed
be mindful of time of day effects for each taxon studied,
but for the majority of taxa there appear to be no effects.
This recommendation however, only pertains to beat sheet
sampling between 06:00 and 18:00 hours and differences
may exist when using alternative sampling methods or
when sampling at night. It is likely that sampling methods
that bias collection to the upper part of the canopy, such as
suction sampling, will be more sensitive to time of day
effects (Rancourt et al., 2000).

Diel variation in estimates of arthropod abundance has
been generally attributed to altered arthropod activity and
distribution, however, this linkage has rarely been con-
firmed. Shepard et al. (1974b) used direct observations of
the diel variation in the distribution of big-eyed bugs (Geo-
coris spp.) within the plant canopy to confirm beat sheet
sampling estimates, but no mention was made of altered
bug activity or plant structure location that may influence
abundance estimates. For example, visual estimates of
N. americoferus abundance at different times of the day are
associated with bug feeding activity (Braman & Yeargan,
1989).

However,
according to Snodgrass (1993), beat sheet and sweep-net
estimates of the densities of tarnished plant bug, Lygus lin-
eolaris (Palisot de Beauvois), were not influenced by their
distribution (i.e., on leaves, terminals, or inside bracts of
squares). Future manipulative studies may utilize an artifi-
cial infestation technique to better understand the rela-
tionship between time of day, arthropod behaviour, and
distribution and beat sheet estimates; this would involve
placement of a known number of arthropods at various
plant locations followed by beat sheet sampling at different
times of the day (e.g., Marston et al., 1979; Snodgrass,
1993).

**
Future research should develop robust correction factors
to adjust arthropod count data derived from various
methods by repeating this study across numerous fields,
over several growing seasons, and with numerous persons
involved (to test for observer bias) (see Ruesink & Hayes,
1973; Fleischer et al., 1985; Schotzko & O’Keeffe, 1989).
Without this additional research it is not possible to gener-
alize about the effect of temporal variation in arthropod
sampling effectiveness. Finally, action thresholds for key
predators need to be better refined to facilitate the use
of predator information in pest management decision-
making. A prerequisite to establishment of these thresholds
is the development of a reliable and efficient sampling method
for key entomophagous and phytophagous arthropods
(Sparks & Boethel, 1987), which has been met by this study.
